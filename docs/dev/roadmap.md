# Roadmap

**Status: living.** The *sequencing* layer: the order work happens in and what blocks what.
It owns **order and dependencies only**. The *what* is in the linked files, the *why* in
[decisions.md](decisions.md) and the postmortems.

**Keeping this current:** when a task lands, the same session ticks it here and adds the
next one, the same way it runs the drift check. When a milestone completes, the next one
gets expanded into ordered tasks, and the finished milestone shrinks to a one-line "Landed"
entry linking its record in [roadmap-archive/](roadmap-archive/) (status
`archive (landed DATE)`). Archive eagerly, as soon as only open follow-ups remain.

**Detail is tiered:** the next milestone is checkbox-level; later ones are one-line
destinations until the work before them teaches us their shape.

A feature with its own design plan keeps that plan in a transient folder (`TRANSIENT_DIRS`
in `scripts/check_docs.py`); this file names the plan and its place in the order, and never
restates its stages.

## Next session (updated 2026-10-30)

1. M5's five stages merged on 2026-10-30 as PR #101. Only its cleanup is open, and that waits
   a release. See [server-state-plan/README.md](server-state-plan/README.md) for what was
   checked by hand.
2. M4 is next, as a port and not a fresh build: the rating column (§1) already exists on
   `feat/scoring-arc`. Follow § Porting the unmerged branches. Read the plan as it stands on
   that branch (docs/dev/roadmap/roadmap.md there), because `main`'s
   [rating-plan/README.md](rating-plan/README.md) predates the work and still calls §1 unbuilt.
3. Two docs seams stay queued in [pending-splits.md](pending-splits.md) with nothing over
   budget: `README.md`'s § Features deletion (deferred when its budget went to 4,000) and
   `docs/scoring.md`'s residual seam. Either is picked up by the next session that appends
   to its file. Re-measure first and check both halves land under 60% of budget — five of
   M3's seven recorded seams had to be re-cut on execution.
4. A split moves sections, so `§` pointers that named a section in the same file now
   point across files. `check_docs.py` does not check them, so grep `§` in every touched
   file and check each against the destination's headings by hand.

## Landed

- **M1 — Drift check upgrade** (2026-10-29): the reference checker, CI on every PR, this
  roadmap and the decision log. Record:
  [roadmap-archive/m1-drift-check-upgrade.md](roadmap-archive/m1-drift-check-upgrade.md).
- **M2 — CLAUDE.md** (2026-10-29): a Verification section with one gate table, and CLAUDE.md
  back under budget at 5,399 words. Record:
  [roadmap-archive/m2-claude-md.md](roadmap-archive/m2-claude-md.md).
- **M3 — The split queue** (2026-10-30): every over-budget doc split, four families behind
  hubs, and README's budget raised to 4,000 rather than cut. Record:
  [roadmap-archive/m3-split-queue.md](roadmap-archive/m3-split-queue.md).

## Porting the unmerged branches

Three branches hold work from August that never reached `main`, and none has an open PR. They
land one at a time, in the order M4, M6, M7. M4 and M7 conflict with each other in six files, so
M7 goes after M4; M6 touches neither and is the smallest.

1. Cut each port's branch from the latest `main`, and merge it before starting the next. All
   three add migrations from old revisions, so each re-parents onto the head the last one left.
2. `git cherry-pick -x` the commits its milestone names, so the messages and the link to the
   original survive. Skip merge commits.
3. Port doc changes by hand into `main`'s current layout rather than resolving their conflicts.
   A plan file gets its own transient folder, registered in `TRANSIENT_DIRS`.
4. Before merging, check every path added to `main` since the branch was cut. A clean port only
   reconciles lines that clash, and a missed mirror or rebuild path fails silently.
5. Leave the source branch untouched until its port has merged.

## Milestones

### M5 — App-stored prompts

Saved prompts moved from the browser to the database, merged on 2026-10-30 as PR #101. Neither
this nor M4 depends on the other. Gate: the cleanup below done, once browsers have had a release
to copy their data over. Design: [server-state-plan/README.md](server-state-plan/README.md). Ruling:
[decision 3](decisions/03-app-stored-prompts.md).

- [x] Stage 1: backend models, migration, routes and the import endpoint.
- [x] Stage 2: caption prompt presets. Needs stage 1.
- [x] Stage 3: ComfyUI "Generate prompts" settings, and the conflict dialog. Needs stage 2.
- [x] Stage 4: the captioning workflow blob. Needs stage 3, for the writer and the loading gate.
- [x] Stage 5: declared categories. Needs stage 2.
- [ ] Cleanup, one release after PR #101: delete the legacy keys, the import code and the plan
  folder, then archive this milestone.

### M4 — Rating feature

Gate: the rating column and head phase 0 shipped with their user docs, and the learned head
either shipped or ruled out by phase 0's numbers. Build order and stage detail:
[rating-plan/README.md § Sequencing](rating-plan/README.md#sequencing), which the port brings up
to date. Open rulings go in the decision log as they are made.

- [x] Token UI (§6) and the aesthetic model picker (§2), both shipped 2026-08-02.
- [ ] Port the rating column (§1) and head phase 0 (the rating event log and metrics page) from
  `feat/scoring-arc`: 67ac441, 9004f18, 4233da1, ce0c788. Needs no ML.
- [ ] The learned head (§3, phases 1+). Needs the port and re-ratings to measure. Not built if
  phase 0 shows an existing scorer already near its ceiling.
- DINOv3 (§5) stays deferred, the lowest priority. M7's plan supersedes §5, so it is settled
  there.

### M6 — ComfyUI per-row folders and automation

Gate: per-row folders merged with their docs, then the remaining stages expanded here in their
plan's order.

- [ ] Port per-row output folders from `comfy-per-row-subfolders`: c2d6a6d. Its plan comes with
  it (docs/dev/roadmap/comfy-automation.md on that branch).

### M7 — Style embedding

Gate: the layer and blend change merged with its docs, then the remaining stages expanded here
in their plan's order. Needs M4 merged.

- [ ] Decide whether the layer 7 default stands, given that the photograph test failed its
  pre-registered criterion. See docs/dev/roadmap/style-embedding.md on the branch.
- [ ] Port from `style-embedding-measurement`: every commit except 3b00223, already on `main`,
  and the doc splits 9f6219e and 9156988, because `main` made its own.
